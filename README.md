# Impress.js
This framework makes easy to create slides using web technologies.

You only need to know HTML and CSS (also you could learn JavaScript to add more powerful utilities).

[Here](https://github.com/impress/impress.js) you have the documentation.

Also there are [more pluggins](https://github.com/impress/impress.js/tree/master/src/plugins) that provide more options.

List of some useful plugins:
- autoplay : advance slide after a period of time
- progress : displays a bar with the progress of the slides viewed
- impressConsole : add notes for the presenter
- goto : jump to a specific slide
- toolbar : presentation toolbar
- substep : add different substeps to a slide
